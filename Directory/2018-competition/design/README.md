# Design


**[Main Body](RMRCmainbody5_0.stl)**

> This body was designed with durablity in mind. The body contain little to no corners, because this is where the stress fractures occur durring falls and other rough handling. The curved edges allow the stress to be distributed among a much greater surface area. This body was printed in "tough PLA" because this material is much more flexible than normal PLA, this allows the body itself to act as a suspension system when absoorbing shock and torgue from falls and other general use. 

>This body was printed on a makerbot Z18 3-D printer using the following settings:

>>             Temperature: 215 degrees C

>>     Chamber Temperature: 40 degrees C
 
>>            Layer Height: .1 MM

>>          Infill Density: 30%

>>          Infill Pattern: Hexagonal

>>            Travel Speed: 150 mm/s

>>        Number of Shells: 2

.

**[Claw Wheel](v1_1_claw_wheel.stl)**

>This style of wheel allows the robot to traverse hazzardous terrain with relative ease.The claw like style allows the wheel to dig an edge into the terrain and drag itself foward: so if one wheel gains traction the entire robot moves foward. The outside edges of the wheels are coated in [plastidip](https://smile.amazon.com/Plasti-Dip-Performix-12213-Black/dp/B00I9SK8XY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1536463716&sr=8-1&keywords=plastidip+rubber+paint) to give the outer surface more traction.
