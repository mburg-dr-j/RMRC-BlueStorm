# Claw Wheel

[Claw Wheel]()

>This style of wheel allows the robot to traverse hazzardous terrain with relative ease.The claw like style allows the wheel to dig an edge into the terrain and drag itself foward: so if one wheel gains traction the entire robot moves foward. The outside edges of the wheels are coated in plastidip to give the outer surface more traction.
