# Dynamixel Heat Sink


[Heat Sink](dynamixel_heat_sink)

> This heat sink is designed to be placed on the rear end of a dynamixel after the casing has been dremeled out(shown in the picture and video). It is glued to the dc motor within the dynamixel to allow the dynamixel to disapate heat more efficiently and thus extend the servos' continuous running time greatly.
