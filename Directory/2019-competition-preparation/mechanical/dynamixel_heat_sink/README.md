# Dynamixel Heat Sink


[Heat Sink](v1_1_dynamixel_heat_sink.stl)

> This heat sink is designed to be placed on the rear end of a dynamixel after the casing has been dremeled out(shown in the picture and video). It is glued to the dc motor using a thermal compound to allow the dynamixel to disapate heat more efficiently and thus extend the servos' continuous running time greatly.
