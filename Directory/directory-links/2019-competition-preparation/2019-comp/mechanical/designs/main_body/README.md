# Main Body






[v7_5](v7_5_body_RMRC.stl)

> I have gone back to using the 3mm design because tests proved that the 2mm design was too thin and broke too easily. I have also incorperated an angled usb camera mount, which will allow us to see the contact point of our wheels so that we will be able to have a chance at align. The final addition to this version is the addition of a substance called [3-D Gloop](https://www.3dgloop.com/shop/pla-gloop). This substance is an adhesive that we are using to help join the different layers of the print because we were having trouble with the bodies breaking at the seams during tests. For the stress tests of this design use the following links:

>Stress tests:

>> For each of these test we are using:

>>>-V7_5 body

>>>-Dynamixel AX-12As

>>>-Claw wheels

>>>-1450 grams of weight, 700 grams of added weights.

>1M drop test:

>[Test 1]()

>>>This is a flat test where all points contact the floor at reletively the same time. This test showed that the body hadles this stress extremly well

>[Test 2]()

>> This is a tilted test where the front two points contact first then the back two point

> 1.5M drop test:

>[Test 3]()

>>This test was messed up when we dropped it. The body turned on its side and thus everything went wrong as can be seen in the video. This shows the importance of lining up before the fall. Overall, I am impressed by the 1.5M drop because the only damage to the body was cause by the agle of the impact and if it were done again correctly I believe that the body would survive and there would only be a few broken gears in the dynamixels.

> I have reduced the size of the curves along the edges to reduce wasted space as well as make the chasis thinner to allow the robot more clearance on the course.
