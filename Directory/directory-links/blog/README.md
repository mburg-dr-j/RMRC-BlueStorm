>Gary, the newest member to our team. He is specializing in software, specifically machine learning and thermal imaging.

 >We are working on several projects at the moment. First, Collin is incorperating the [Udoo x86](https://www.udoo.org/udoo-x86/) into our robot to replace both of the raspberry pi's and the arduino. He will then implement [VNC](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/windows/) to remotly control the robot. Second Joseph is working on incorperating a compact arm into the robot. The arm will take a long time to develop and is still in the extremely early stages, but updates and designs will be posted periodically. Joseph is also working on adjusting the wheel design to be more effective on the hurdle course. Gary is working on a more reliable system for hazmat label recongnition.
 
>Once the robot is up and running again we are going to run tests to see whether speed or torque will be more valuable to the robot in the future. Depeding on the results of the test, we will upgrade to either the dynamixel [XM430W210T](http://support.robotis.com/en/product/actuator/dynamixel_x/xm_series/xm430-w210.htm), or the dynamixel XM430W350T.
